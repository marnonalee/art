                <br>
                <p>Filipino artist Benedict Reyes Cabrera, also referred to as Bencab, is well-known. He is considered one of the most notable current Filipino artists and has significantly influenced Philippine art. Bencab was born in Malabon, Metro Manila, Philippines, on April 10, 1942.</p>
                   <br>
                <p>His proficiency in a variety of artistic mediums, such as painting, printmaking, and sculpting, is well known. Bencab's art is defined by a fusion of traditional and contemporary inspirations, and he frequently includes aspects of Philippine history and culture in his creations. His works of art are renowned for their distinctive use of lines, vivid colors, and minute details.</p>
                  <br>
                <p>Bencab is renowned for his portrayals of the human form, which frequently draw attention to the charm and difficulties of the Filipino people. His writings include both his own experiences and observations as well as societal and political concerns.</p>

             <h2>Educational Background</h2>
                <br>
                <p>On April 10, 1942, Democrito Cabrera and Isabel Reyes had BenCab in Malabon, Philippines. BenCab was the youngest of nine children.  His older brother Salvador, who was already a well-known artist when BenCab was a young boy, introduced him to the arts. He was the youngest of the nine children.
He continued his education at the University of the Philippines, Diliman, where he graduated in 1963 with a bachelor's degree in fine arts.</p>
                   <br>
                 <h2>Family and European Career</h2>
                 <br>
                 <p>BenCab got married Caroline Kennedy in London in 1969 after they had met in Manila in 1968. They made the decision to remain in London. They are parents of three kids. The couple's middle child, Mayumi, was born in Manila in 1973 and went on to become a successful model in both London and Los Angeles. Their oldest kid, Elisar, was born in 1971 and is now a film and web series producer. He is married to award-winning playwright and web series writer, Lisa Gifford, who is based in London. Together with her partner John A. Fries, they currently reside in Los Angeles with their two children, Ronan (2011) and Ione (2013). Jasmine, their youngest child, was born in 1977 and presently resides in Baguio and works with BenCab at the BenCab Museum.</p>
                   <br>
                <p>Although Bencab's early years as a painter in London " were not particularly easy," his abilities were quickly acknowledged. He built a reputation of worldwide significance over the following four decades, exhibiting shows from London to New York to Macau, and taking home several significant art prizes over the course of his four-decade career. In 1985, however, BenCab's 16-year marriage with Kennedy ended in divorce, and he eventually decided to come home to the Philippines.</p>
